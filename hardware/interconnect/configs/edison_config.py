# edison_config.py :- configuration for a dragonfly-based Edison supercomputer

# Aries has 96 switches per group, 4 nodes per switch; 40 network ports per host
# and 8 processor tiles:  "Cray XC Series Network" whitepaper

# Edison has 15 groups (out of possible 241 groups): 
# "Analyzing Network Health and Congestion in Dragonfly-based Systems"

# The Aries router connects 8 NIC ports to 40 network ports, operating at rates
# of 4.7 to 5.25GB/s per direction per port: "Cray XC series Network" whitepaper

# Peak bandwidth of the 16X PCI-Express Gen3 interface connecting each Cray XC series
# node to its Aries is 16GB/s, 8 giga-transfers per second, each of 16 bits: 
# "Cray XC series Network" whitepaper

# Inter group link bandwidth 4.7 GB/s per direction and intra group link 
# bandwidth 5.25 GB/s per direction: "Analyzing Network Health and Congestion 
# in Dragonfly-based Systems"

# Delay reference (used):
# For a quiet network, each router-to-router hop adds approximately 100ns of latency,
# a maximum of 500ns for minimally routed packets.
# For an 8-byte MPI message, measured end-to-end latency is 1.3us.
# Therefore, switch-to-host latency is: (1.3-0.5)/2 = 0.4us.
