# stampede_config.py :- configuration for a fat-tree-based Stampede topology

# https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede
# The 56GB/s FDR InfiniBand interconnect consists of Mellanox switches, 
# fiber cables and HCAs (Host Channel Adapters). Eight 648-port SX6536 core switches
# and over 320 36-port SX6025 endpoint switches (2 in each compute-node rack) 
# form a 2-level Clos fat tree topology, illustrated in Figure 1.4. 
# Core and endpoint switches have 4.0 and 73 Tb/s capacities, respectively. 
# There is a 5/4 oversubscription at the endpoint (leaf) switches (20 node input 
# ports: 16 core-switch output ports). Any MPI message is only 5 hops or less from source to destination.

# http://www.mellanox.com/page/performance_infiniband
# Latency for Mellanox FDR IB is: 0.7us
