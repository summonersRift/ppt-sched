# trinity_config.py :- configuration for a dragonfly-based Trinity supercomputer

# Aries has 96 switches per group, 4 nodes per switch; 40 network ports per host
# and 8 processor tiles:  "Cray XC Series Network" whitepaper

# The Aries router connects 8 NIC ports to 40 network ports, operating at rates
# of 4.7 to 5.25GB/s per direction per port: "Cray XC series Network" whitepaper

# Peak bandwidth of the 16X PCI-Express Gen3 interface connecting each Cray XC series
# node to its Aries is 16GB/s, 8 giga-transfers per second, each of 16 bits: 
# "Cray XC series Network" whitepaper

# Inter group link bandwidth 4.7 GB/s per direction and intra group link 
# bandwidth 5.25 GB/s per direction: "Analyzing Network Health and Congestion 
# in Dragonfly-based Systems"

# Delay references:
# "Characterization of the Cray Aries Network" by Brian Austin (slide 7)
# Blade latency: 1.3us. host-switch latency: 1.3/2 = 0.65us
# Rank-1 latency: 1.5us. blade-blade latency: 1.5us
# Rank-2 latency: 1.5us. chassis-chassis latency: 1.5us
# Rank-3 latency: 2.2us. inter-group latency: 2.2us
