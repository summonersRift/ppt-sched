To install LuaJIT, git clone 2.1.alpha repository, then just change the PREFIX directory
in the top Makefile and do "make install"

Note that it is important to do
"make install"
Otherwise LuaJIT will run slower (but still about the same speed as cPython), as JITing
will not get enabled, since LuaJIT's internal jit.* modules do not get resolved and
loaded correctly.

Also adjust the paths in "run" example in the Simian top directory to match the
LuaJIT install path.
